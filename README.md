# Plagiarism-Checker-Web-development


## 📝 Summary

The idea for this project originates from a common problem faced in academia, research, and content creation — **plagiarism**.  
Students, writers, researchers, and organizations often struggle to ensure originality in their work. While plagiarism checkers exist, many are expensive, closed-source, or lack flexibility for integration into custom workflows.

Our **Plagiarism Detection Web Application** solves this problem by offering a **free, accessible, and developer-friendly platform** for detecting plagiarism in multiple file formats (TXT, DOCX, PDF).  
It analyzes text using **AI-powered similarity algorithms** (TF-IDF + cosine similarity), highlights matching portions, and calculates a plagiarism score.  

The system allows:
- **Users** to upload or paste content and instantly check for plagiarism.
- **Custom corpus checking** — compare against local documents.
- **Optional web scraping** to detect matches from online sources.
- **PDF/DOCX parsing** for easy academic use.

## 📸 Features

- 📂 **Multi-format support**: `.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`  
- 🖍 **Highlighting plagiarized text** in results  
- 📊 **Similarity percentage** calculation  
- 🌍 **Optional online source checking** using BeautifulSoup4 + Requests  
- 📑 **Downloadable plagiarism report**  
- 🖥 **Responsive HTML UI** (Jinja2 templates)  
- ⚡ **Fast API responses** with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend  
- 🛡 **Input sanitization** and file type restrictions

## 🏆 Achievements

- Designed as a **lightweight, open-source alternative** to commercial plagiarism checkers.  
- **Fast processing** even for large documents thanks to efficient TF-IDF vectorization.  
- Supports **integration with other platforms** via REST API.
